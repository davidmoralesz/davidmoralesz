## About Me

With over six years of dedicated experience in the BPO industry, I have honed a diverse skill set that consistently bolsters the success of each team I join. My approach to leadership blends care, trust, ownership, and humility, embodying my dedication to nurturing growth, driving innovation, and achieving collective goals.

I began my career as a graphic designer, proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, and Premiere Pro. Transitioning from graphic design to web design and finally to web development, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of the entire digital creation process.

As a seasoned Web Developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing and high-performing web experiences that captivate audiences and drive results. With a keen eye for design and a passion for innovation, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to translate marketing strategies into functional and engaging digital assets.
